/*Design a class to overload a function volume() as follows:
(i) double volume(double r) – with radius ‘r’ as an argument, returns the volume of sphere using the formula:
v = 4 / 3 × 22 / 7 × r3
(ii)double volume(double h, double r) – with height ‘h’ and radius ‘r’ as the arguments, returns the volume of a cylinder using the formula:
v = 22 / 7 × r2 × h
(iii) double volume(double l, double b, double h) – with length ‘l’, breadth ‘b’ and height ‘h’ as the arguments, returns the volume of a cuboid using the formula:
v = l × b × h
